Console Guitar Hero and Rock Band player on-and-off since 2007, former Ocarina of Time speedrunner, and former competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl player.

I have a passion for CRT displays, getting the best experience from pre-FHD era retro console games, as well as achieving high quality capture footage from said retro games for personal archival and preservation purposes.

This site is dedicated for blogging about topics related to said passions.
